To raise money for the City of Irvine's Youth Action Team, we sold hot dogs, chips, popcorn, nachos, drinks, etc. at massive festivals like Irvine Global Village. We were required to perform arithmetic operations in our heads with customers orders. This was very time consuming, allowed for many mistakes, and negatively impacted our efficiency.

Mobile Cashier aims to solve this problem by allowing users to create a menu where they can simple tap the item to add it to cart. Then they can clear the menu for to calculate the next order.
