To raise money for the City of Irvine's Youth Action Team, I had to sell hot dogs, chips, popcorn, nachos, drinks, etc. at massive festivals like Irvine Global Village. I was required to perform arithmetic operations in our heads to calculate customers' orders. This was very time consuming, allowed for many mistakes, and negatively impacted our overall efficiency.

Mobile Cashier aims to solve this problem by allowing users to create a custom menu where they can simply tap the item to add it to cart and final price. Then they can clear the menu to calculate the next order, or add another item to the menu.
